A high quality sound board, close-talking, high quality microphone and a nearly soundproof 
recording environment will often be the compromise between these two extremes.

You will need to define
Phone set
Token processing rules (numbers etc)
Prosodic phrasing method
Word pronunciation (lexicon and/or letter-to-sound rules)
Intonation (accents and F0 contour)
Durations
Waveform synthesizer

As a practical recommendation to make a new speaker in an existing supported language, you will need to consider
Waveform synthesis
Speaker specific intonation
Speaker specific duration

We also do work on limited domain synthesis in the same framework. For limited domain synthesis, 
a reasonably small corpus is collected, and used to synthesize a much larger range of utterances in the 
same basic style. We give an example of recording a talking clock, which, although built from only 24 
recordings, generates over a thousand unique utterances; these capture a lot of the latent speaker 
characteristics from the data.
